# CLAUDE.md - Bot Instructions

## Project Structure

This project uses **two separate jj-git repos**:

1. **App repo** (`/` — project root): Contains the application source code.
2. **Bot session repo** (`/.claude/`): Contains Claude Code session data.

Both repos are managed with `jj` (Jujutsu), which coexists with git.

## Repo Paths (relative from project root)

- App repo: `.` (project root)
- Bot session repo: `.claude`
  (symlink from `~/.claude/projects/<path-to-project-root>/.claude`)

## Working Directory

Prefer staying in the project root. Use `-R` flags or absolute paths
to target other directories rather than `cd`. If `cd` seems necessary,
discuss with the user first — losing track of cwd causes subtle
command failures downstream.

When invoking shell commands, prefer the shortest unambiguous path —
usually relative to cwd (`ls notes/`, not
`ls /home/wink/data/prgs/rust/vc-x1/notes/`). Long absolute paths
clutter the transcript without adding information. Out-of-workspace
paths (`/tmp/...`, `~/.config/...`) stay absolute. Read/Edit/Write
tool args also stay absolute — that's a tool-boundary constraint,
not a stylistic choice.

## Memory

Do not use the bot's per-project memory directory
(`~/.claude/projects/<path>/memory/`). In a dual-repo setup with
CLAUDE.md it provides no capability CLAUDE.md doesn't already cover,
and it loses on discoverability:

- **CLAUDE.md** — at the repo root, a well-known location for bot
  instructions, committed, reviewable, visible to every collaborator
  (human or bot).
- **Memory directory** — hidden under the user's home, tied to one
  machine, invisible to anyone but the bot, never diffed or reviewed.

Easy for everyone to find beats convenient for the bot alone. Put
durable context in CLAUDE.md (or committed `notes/`) instead.

## Speculation marker

Durable text the bot writes — CLAUDE.md, `notes/`, commit bodies,
chores sections — should stick to observations and direct descriptions
of the code or data. If a mechanism, hypothesis, or causal claim
enters the text, prefix it with "The bot thinks ..." so a reader can
tell the measured from the inferred.

**Why:** unmarked speculation reads like evidence, and a future reader
(or the bot on a later session) can pick it up as a known fact when
it's not. Measured / inferred is a distinction worth keeping visible
in the written record.

**How to apply:** observations and factual descriptions need no
marker. Prefix with "The bot thinks ..." (or a close variant like
"The bot's guess is ...") when the claim is a mechanism ("X wins
because Y caches better"), a cause ("the drift was due to thermal
state"), a prediction ("this should scale linearly"), or any
reasoning not directly supported by the data on hand.

## Committing

Use `-R` (`--repository`) at the end to target the correct repo. Use
relative paths to reduce noise. Putting `-R` last keeps the verb/action
visible at the start of the command.

### App repo
```
jj commit -m \
"title" \
-m "body

ochid: /.claude/<changeID>" \
-R .
```

### Bot session repo
```
jj commit -m \
"title" \
-m "body

ochid: /<changeID>" \
-R .claude
```

## jj Basics

- `jj st -R .` / `jj st -R .claude` — show working copy status
- `jj log -R .` / `jj log -R .claude` — show commit log
- `jj commit -m "title" -m "body" -R <repo>` — finalize working copy into a commit
- `jj describe -m "title" -m "body" -R <repo>` — set description without committing
- `jj git push --bookmark <name> -R <repo>` — push a bookmark (no
  `--allow-new` flag; jj pushes new bookmarks without special flags)
- In jj, the working copy (@) is always a mutable commit being edited.
  `jj commit` finalizes it and creates a new empty working copy on top.
- The `.claude` repo always has uncommitted changes during an active
  session because session data updates continuously.

## Commit Message Style

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) with
a version suffix:

```
<type>: <short description> (<version>)
```

- **Title**: target ~50 chars, short summary of *what* changed.
  Include the version. Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`,
  `test`, `docs`, `chore`.
- **App-repo body**: short intro paragraph (1–3 sentences), then a
  terse bullet list. Each bullet corresponds one-to-one with the
  edits structure already documented in `notes/chores-*.md` for
  this step — just the file and a one-line gist (e.g.
  `README.md: new Overview intro`). Do *not* restate the detail
  that lives in chores; the commit body is a scan-able index, not
  a duplicate. The chores section is the source of truth.
- **Session-repo body**: terse intro + a few session-activity
  bullets. Doesn't need to mirror chores since it describes
  in-session work, not code changes.
- Examples:
  - `feat: add fix-ochid subcommand (0.22.0)`
  - `fix: fix-ochid prefix bug (0.22.1)`
  - `refactor: deduplicate common CLI flags (0.21.1)`

## Pre-commit Requirements

### User approval

Never execute commit, squash, push, or finalize commands without the
user's explicit approval. Present changes for review first; only run
them after the user confirms. This applies to late changes too —
pause for review before squashing into an existing commit.

### Review before proposing the commit block

After finishing a unit of work, **summarize what changed and stop
there**. Do not pre-emptively lay out the Checkpoint-1 commit
commands. Wait for the user to signal review is complete before
proposing the commit block. Changes during review are the norm,
not the exception; proposing commit text too early creates noise
and signals that I consider the work done when it usually isn't.

This applies per-step in a multi-step flow too — each step gets a
review pause before its commit block appears.

Signals that review is complete include explicit approval ("let's
commit", "looks good, commit it") **and any directive to start the
next step** ("do step 4", "next", "go N+1"). In that case the
previous step must be committed first — always commit the current
step before starting the next; don't ask.

### Notes references

Multiple references must be separated: `[2],[3]` not `[2,3]` or `[2][3]`.
See [Todo format](notes/README.md#todo-format) for details.

### Markdown anchor links

GitHub anchor algorithm: lowercase, strip non-alphanumeric
characters in place, map remaining spaces to hyphens 1-for-1. Do
**not** collapse adjacent whitespace — so `a + b` → `a--b` (spaces
on both sides of `+`), but `a: b` → `a-b` (only trailing space on
`:`). General markdown reference:
[markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org). GitHub
publishes no official spec for auto-generated anchors; the
de-facto reference implementation is
[github-slugger](https://github.com/Flet/github-slugger).

### Versioning

Every plan must start with a version bump. Choose the approach based
on scope:

- **Single-step** (recommended for mechanical/focused changes): bump
  directly to `X.Y.Z`, implement in one commit. Simpler history.
- **Multi-step** (for exploratory/large changes): bump to `X.Y.Z-0`,
  implement across multiple commits incrementing the numeric
  suffix. The final commit drops the suffix.

The plan should recommend one approach and get user approval before
starting.

For multi-step:

1. Bump version to `X.Y.Z-0` with the plan and commit as a chore
   marker.
2. Implement in one or more `X.Y.Z-N` commits (increment N as
   needed).
3. Final commit bumps to `X.Y.Z` (no suffix), updates
   `notes/todo.md` and `notes/chores-*.md` — this is the "done"
   marker.

Multi-step cycles surface the ladder at the top of
`notes/todo.md > ## In Progress` as a bullet list with `(done)` /
`(current)` markers — see the file's intro paragraph for the
format. Update the markers as each step ships so the In Progress
view stays current at a glance.

**Why numeric suffixes (`-0`, `-1`, …) rather than `-devN`:**
semver pre-release identifiers may consist of a single numeric
component, and they compare numerically per spec. So
`X.Y.Z-1 < X.Y.Z-2 < … < X.Y.Z` correctly orders the dev ladder
below the done marker. Cargo accepts this form. The `-dev` prefix
adds no information the git log doesn't already convey and
doubles typing per commit.

The final release commit (no suffix) signals completion rather than
amending prior commits. This keeps history readable and makes it easy
to see which commits were exploratory vs final.

### Chores section headers

Chores section headers use trailing version format:

```
## Description (X.Y.Z)
```

Example: `` ## Add `fn claude-symlink` (0.27.0) ``

### Pre-commit checklist

Before proposing a commit, run all of the following and fix any issues:

1. `cargo fmt`
2. `cargo clippy`
3. `cargo test`
4. `cargo install --path . --locked` (if applicable) — `--locked`
   is required: without it, `cargo install` ignores `Cargo.lock`
   and re-resolves from scratch, which can pick incompatible
   versions even when `cargo build` / `cargo test` succeed.
5. Retest after install
6. Update `notes/todo.md` — add to `## Done` if completing a task
7. Update `notes/chores-*.md` — add a subsection describing the change
8. Update `notes/README.md` — if functionality changed (new flags,
   new subcommands, changed behavior)

## Code Conventions

### Doc comments on every file, function, and method

Every `.rs` file must begin with a `//!` module docstring. Every
function and method must have a `///` doc comment. Keep them brief —
one sentence of purpose is often enough; the discipline is that the
comment exists, not that it be long.

This is a deliberate override of the generic "write no comments"
default that applies to inline `//` comments. Doc comments on the
module / item surface are expected; inline explanatory comments
inside function bodies remain discouraged unless they capture a
non-obvious WHY.

**Shape:** short intro (1–3 sentences, shorter is better), then
a `-` bullet list for any structured details. Avoid long prose
paragraphs — they read as a wall of text and hide the structure
that bullets make scannable. Same shape applies to:

- Module / function / struct / field doc comments in `.rs` files.
- Chore descriptions in `notes/chores-NN.md`.
- Todo entries in `notes/todo.md` (when an item needs more than
  one line of detail; pure one-liners are still fine).

**Clap-derive args:** doc comments on `#[arg(...)]` fields drive
`--help` output. Clap reflows by default and collapses bullets
into running prose. Add `#[arg(verbatim_doc_comment, ...)]` on
any field whose doc comment uses bullets so each `- …` lands on
its own line in the rendered help.

### `// OK: …` comments on `unwrap*` calls (Rust)

Non-test code that calls `.unwrap()`, `.unwrap_or(…)`,
`.unwrap_or_default()`, or `.unwrap_or_else(…)` must have a trailing
`// OK: …` comment that justifies why the call is acceptable.

- `// OK: <specific reason>` — document the real precondition,
  invariant, or domain reason. Preferred whenever the reason isn't
  self-evident.
- `// OK: obvious` — the default is self-evident from context (e.g.
  `desc.lines().next().unwrap_or("")` — empty desc → empty title).

Bare `// OK` is not used (reads like a truncated comment).
Abbreviations (e.g. `SE`) are not used because they require a decoder
ring for readers seeing the code out of context.

For provably-unreachable `.unwrap()` calls, also prefix with
`#[allow(clippy::unwrap_used)]` so the site stays silent if we enable
the project-wide `clippy::unwrap_used` lint later.

```rust
let max = stderr_level.unwrap_or(LevelFilter::Info); // OK: default verbosity when -v/-vv absent
let first_line = desc.lines().next().unwrap_or("");  // OK: obvious

match matches.len() {
    1 => {
        #[allow(clippy::unwrap_used)]
        // OK: `1 =>` arm guarantees matches.len() == 1
        Ok(TitleMatch::One(matches.into_iter().next().unwrap()))
    }
    // ...
}
```

Tests (`#[cfg(test)]`) are exempt — panicking on setup failure is the
correct test behavior.

### Ask for clarification on ambiguous input

When user input is ambiguous or missing necessary detail, stop and
ask a specific question. Do not proceed on a guess and hope the
result lands right — a clarifying question costs a few seconds;
redoing misaligned work costs much more.

### Recognize when stuck

If a simple task has eaten 5+ minutes of thinking or back-and-forth
without progress, stop. Summarize what's blocking — unclear
requirements, unfamiliar API surface, conflicting signals — and ask.
Continued flailing produces worse outcomes than a direct "I'm stuck
on X."

## ochid Trailers

Every commit body must include an `ochid:` trailer pointing to the
counterpart commit in the other repo. The value is a workspace-root-relative
path followed by the changeID:

- App repo commits point to `.claude`: `ochid: /.claude/<changeID>`
- Bot session commits point to app repo: `ochid: /<changeID>`

Use `vc-x1 chid -R .,.claude -L` to get both changeIDs (first line
is app repo, second is `.claude`).

## Commit-Push-Finalize Flow

**Use `vc-x1 push <bookmark>` — it wraps the full flow in one
command with two interactive approval gates.** Push runs
preflight (sync + fmt + clippy + test), prompts for review,
composes the commit message (via `--title`/`--body` or `$EDITOR`),
prompts for message approval, then commits both repos → advances
bookmarks → pushes app → finalizes `.claude`. Failures inside the
local mutation window roll both repos back via `jj op restore`;
after `push-app` succeeds the remote boundary is crossed and
recovery is forward-only.

**Run this flow after every step** — not only at session end.
Single-step and multi-step changes are of equal importance: a
single-step change is one `push` invocation; a multi-step change
is one `push` per `X.Y.Z-N` commit plus one for the final release
commit. Each step gets its own commit, its own push, and its own
finalize — so dev markers land on the remote and in `.claude` as
they happen rather than being batched until the end.

### Run `vc-x1 push`

```
vc-x1 push main                                      # interactive (review + $EDITOR)
vc-x1 push main --title "..." --body "..."           # flags skip $EDITOR
vc-x1 push main --yes --title "..." --body "..."     # full non-interactive
vc-x1 push main --dry-run                            # preview (no side effects)
vc-x1 push main --from commit-app                    # resume from specific stage
vc-x1 push --status                                  # show saved state
vc-x1 push main --restart                            # clear saved state; start fresh
```

The two approval gates are surfaced by push itself:

1. **Review** — push prints `jj diff --stat` for both repos and
   prompts `[y/N]`. Approve = "the work is done right".
2. **Message** — push either uses `--title`/`--body` (non-editor
   path) or opens `$EDITOR` on a template. Approve = "the message
   reads right".

Both titles and bodies are the **same** across the two commits;
only the `ochid:` trailer differs per repo. Push collects the
pre-commit chids internally so you don't hand-manage them.

For the full flag list and stage machine, see `vc-x1 push --help`
and `notes/chores-05.md > Add push subcommand (0.37.0)`.

### Bot communication during the flow

When applying the flow on the user's behalf, use plain prose at
each gate — no insider jargon ("Gate N signal", "Checkpoint N",
etc.):

1. **After completing the work** — summarize what changed
   (file-by-file or feature-by-feature, terse) and end with
   something like:

   > Work complete. Please review. On approval I'll prep the
   > commit title and body for a second approval before pushing.

2. **After review approval** — present the proposed `$TITLE` and
   `$BODY` explicitly, then ask permission to run `vc-x1 push`.
   Do **not** spell out the full
   `vc-x1 push <bookmark> --yes --title "$TITLE" --body "$BODY"`
   invocation by default — it's mechanical and obvious from the
   title/body. Show it only on explicit request (verbose mode /
   debugging).

3. **After execution approval** — run the push command. `push`
   handles commit + bookmark + push + finalize internally;
   nothing should be output after the push command (finalize is
   detached and absolute-last; see "After finalize: stop and
   wait" below).

### Pre-step: `vc-x1 sync` (still useful)

Push's preflight runs `vc-x1 sync --check` as its first step. Check
mode verifies divergence without applying — if anything is `behind`
or `diverged`, preflight errors and you resolve explicitly with
`vc-x1 sync --no-check` before re-running push. This keeps the
two approval gates (review, message) authoritative; push never
performs an unsupervised rebase.

Running sync manually before you *start* editing is still cheap
(one line when clean) and surfaces remote changes earlier:

```
vc-x1 sync --check                    # dual-repo workspace, verify
vc-x1 sync --no-check                 # apply (rebase / fast-forward)
vc-x1 sync --check -R .               # single-repo project
vc-x1 sync --check --quiet            # silent; exit code signals result
```

Bots and scripts must pass `--check` or `--no-check` explicitly —
defaults can shift, explicit flags lock in the contract. Interactive
use can take the default (which is `--check`).

Output shape:

- **Clean**: one line — `sync: N repos, all bookmarks up-to-date`.
  Note: scope is bookmark-vs-remote tracking, not working-copy
  cleanliness — `@` may have uncommitted changes; sync doesn't
  speak to that. Proceed.
- **Action needed** (`behind` / `diverged`) under `--check`:
  per-repo fetch + state lines, then a fatal
  `sync: N repos need action — resolve with vc-x1 sync --no-check
  and re-run`. Inspect, run `vc-x1 sync --no-check`, then proceed.
- **`--quiet`**: no output; exit code is the only signal.

### After finalize: stop and wait

After `vc-x1 finalize` is launched — **whether mid-session per-step
or at session end** — you **MUST NEVER** proceed to a next step, edit
files, run tools, or emit any text (prose, recaps, acknowledgements),
until the user explicitly directs you to continue. Treat finalize as
a hard stop for the whole turn. Any final words (e.g. "next is ...")
must be said in the approval prompt *before* executing finalize; the
finalize `Bash` call is the last thing in the turn and nothing
follows it.

This holds even when the next step seems obvious (e.g. "next is
N+1" or "now I should bump the version and commit the release").
Wait. The user controls cadence — every push+finalize is a checkpoint
they may want to inspect, think about, hand off, or take a break at.
Auto-proceeding bypasses that checkpoint and produces unwanted writes
between finalize and the next explicit instruction.

Exceptions to this rule may emerge later but are not authorized at
this stage. Until told otherwise, treat as absolute.

### Late changes after push

If the app repo needs a tweak after `push-app` succeeded (e.g.
updating CLAUDE.md or memory), the commit is immutable. Use
`--ignore-immutable` to squash the changes into `@-` — the
bookmark moves with the rewritten commit — then re-push:

```
jj squash --ignore-immutable -R .
jj git push --bookmark <bookmark> -R .
```

If you squash somewhere other than `@-`, add
`jj bookmark set <bookmark> -r <target> -R .` between those
two commands so the bookmark lands on the rewritten commit.

`.claude` is also mutable via this pattern when needed, though
push's `finalize-claude` stage normally handles trailing session
writes so you rarely hit this case there.

### Manual finalize fallback

If push exited before `finalize-claude` (e.g. `--no-finalize`
was set, or a failure between `push-app` and `finalize-claude`),
run finalize by hand:

```
vc-x1 finalize --repo .claude --squash --push <bookmark> --delay 10 --detach --log /tmp/vc-x1-finalize.log
```

**Nothing should happen after finalize** — no memory writes, no
tool calls, no additional output. If any work is done after
finalize, run finalize again so the trailing writes are captured.
Do **not** echo or restate the finalize output — the Bash tool
already displays it.

**Clear push's saved state after any out-of-band recovery** —
manual `vc-x1 finalize`, manual `jj squash --ignore-immutable`
+ force-push, etc., all leave `.vc-x1/push-state.toml` pointing
at a now-stale halt point. Either `rm .vc-x1/push-state.toml`
or run `vc-x1 push <bookmark> --restart` (which clears and
restarts in one go) before the next `vc-x1 push`. Otherwise
push resumes from a bogus stage and can falsely declare
success.
